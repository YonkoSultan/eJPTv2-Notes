# eJPTv2-Notes

## Setup

After you download the ZIP file within this repo, you need to install [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/releases/tag/v0.63.7) which is a note taking app.

Open the app and simply right click on any note then click `Import into note` and choose the ZIP file.

After that you can benefit from all the notes I've taken during my prep for eJPTv2 exam :
